# Test Post with Invalid Date

This post has a datetime object instead of a string in the date field. The frontmatter parser should handle this, but let's see what happens.

## Expected Issues

1. The date field contains a datetime object instead of a string
2. The image path points to a nonexistent file

## Content

Some test content to see how this renders.

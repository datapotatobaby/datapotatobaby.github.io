# Test Post with Minimal Frontmatter

This is a test post that only has a title in the frontmatter. Let's see how the system handles missing excerpt, date, readTime, category, and image fields.

## What should happen?

The content loader should use fallback values for missing fields:
- excerpt: empty string
- date: empty string  
- readTime: empty string
- category: 'Uncategorized'
- image: placeholder image

## Content

This post has some basic content to test the rendering.

# Home Automation Dashboard

This project provides a central interface for controlling all smart home devices while collecting and visualizing data about home environment and energy usage.

## Project Overview

The home automation system integrates multiple protocols and devices into a unified dashboard that provides both control and monitoring capabilities.

## Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with Docker containers:

### Core Components

- **Node-RED**: Visual programming for device automation
- **MQTT Broker**: Message passing between devices
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series database for sensor data
- **Grafana**: Data visualization and dashboards
- **Home Assistant**: Device integration hub

## Features

### Device Control
- Smart lighting with dimming and color control
- HVAC system automation based on occupancy
- Smart plugs and switches
- Security system integration

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Temperature and humidity tracking
- Energy consumption monitoring
- Air quality measurements
- Motion detection logging

## Technical Implementation

### MQTT Topics Structure
```
home/
├── living-room/
│   ├── temperature
│   ├── humidity
│   └── lights/
├── bedroom/
└── kitchen/
```

### Docker Compose Setup
The entire stack runs in Docker containers for easy deployment and management.

### Data Flow
1. Sensors publish data to MQTT topics
2. Node-RED processes and routes messages
3. InfluxDB stores time-series data
4. Grafana visualizes trends and alerts

## Results

- 15% reduction in energy costs through automated scheduling
- Improved home security with integrated monitoring
- Real-time insights into home environment patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for predictive automation
- Voice control integration
- Mobile app development
- Additional sensor integration
